# ZAUNCHPAD

> Privacy-first cross-chain token launchpad enabling anonymous participation in crypto token launches using zero-knowledge proofs, with deep integration for Solana and NEAR ecosystems.

Zaunchpad is a next-generation decentralized launchpad that bridges the gap between privacy and transparency. It allows users to launch and participate in token sales on Solana while leveraging privacy features through zero-knowledge proofs and cross-chain payment mechanisms via NEAR Intents.

## ✨ Features

### Core Functionality
- **Solana Token Launch**: Create and deploy tokens on Solana with customizable launch parameters
- **Privacy-First Participation**: Anonymous participation using zero-knowledge proofs generated by Phala TEE
- **Cross-Chain Payments**: Pay with tokens from multiple chains (NEAR, Ethereum, etc.) via NEAR Intents (1Click)
- **Token Claiming**: Claim purchased tokens using zk-SNARK proofs after sale ends
- **IPFS Metadata Storage**: Decentralized storage for token metadata using Storacha
- **Token Discovery**: Search and explore launched tokens with real-time statistics

### Blockchain Integrations
- **Solana**: Primary chain for token launches and claims
- **NEAR Protocol**: Cross-chain payment processing via NEAR Intents
- **Omni Bridge**: Cross-chain token address resolution (Solana ↔ NEAR ↔ Ethereum)
- **Meteora DBC**: Dynamic bonding curve integration for swap quotes and price discovery

### Privacy & Security
- **Zero-Knowledge Proofs**: zk-SNARK proofs for anonymous token claims
- **TEE Verification**: Phala Network TEE for secure proof generation
- **Proof Replay Protection**: Nullifier system prevents double-claiming
- **Encrypted Communication**: X25519 key exchange and ChaCha20-Poly1305 encryption

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** >= 18.0.0
- **pnpm** >= 8.0.0

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/zaunchpad/zaunchpad.git
   cd zaunchpad
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   cd app
   pnpm install
   ```

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env.local` file in the `app/` directory:

```env
# Solana Configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_SOL_NETWORK=devnet  # or mainnet-beta
NEXT_PUBLIC_HELIUS_API_KEY=your_helius_api_key
NEXT_PUBLIC_PROGRAM_ID=your_solana_program_id

# NEAR Configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_NEAR_NETWORK=testnet  # or mainnet
NEXT_PUBLIC_TATUM_API_KEY_MAINNET=your_tatum_key
NEXT_PUBLIC_TATUM_API_KEY_TESTNET=your_tatum_key

# NEAR Intents (1Click)
NEXT_PUBLIC_ONECLICK_JWT=your_1click_jwt_token
NEXT_PUBLIC_ONECLICK_API_BASE_URL=https://1click.chaindefuser.com

# IPFS Storage (Storacha)
NEXT_PUBLIC_STORACHA_EMAIL=your_email
NEXT_PUBLIC_STORACHA_PRIVATE_KEY=your_private_key
NEXT_PUBLIC_STORACHA_PROOF=your_proof
NEXT_PUBLIC_STORACHA_SPACE_DID=your_space_did

# TEE Endpoint (Phala Network)
NEXT_PUBLIC_TEE_ENDPOINT=https://your-tee-endpoint.phala.network
```

### Running the Project

#### Development

```bash
cd app
pnpm dev
# Runs on http://localhost:3000
```

#### Production Build

```bash
cd app
pnpm build
pnpm start
```

## 📖 Usage

### Creating a Token

1. Navigate to `/create`
2. Fill in token information (name, symbol, description, image)
3. Configure launch parameters (start/end time, price, supply)
4. Connect Solana wallet
5. Deploy token and launch

### Participating in a Launch

1. Browse tokens at `/token`
2. Select a token to view details
3. Connect wallet (Solana for claims, NEAR/other for payments)
4. Make payment via NEAR Intents (supports multiple chains)
5. Download zk-proof after payment verification
6. Claim tokens after sale ends using the proof

### Claiming Tokens

1. Wait for sale to end
2. Navigate to token detail page
3. Upload your proof ZIP file
4. Connect Solana wallet
5. Submit claim transaction

## 🔐 Security Features

- **Zero-Knowledge Proofs**: Anonymous token claims without revealing purchase details
- **TEE Verification**: Phala Network Trusted Execution Environment for secure proof generation
- **Proof Nullifiers**: Prevents double-claiming of tokens
- **Encrypted Storage**: Proofs stored locally, never transmitted unencrypted
