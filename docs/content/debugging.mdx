- Incorrect chain displayed

**Solutions:**
1. **Switch Network**: Use wallet to switch to correct network
2. **Add Network**: If network missing, add it manually
3. **Verify Chain**: Confirm you're on the right chain (Solana/NEAR)
4. **Check RPC**: Ensure RPC endpoint is correct

### Token Issues

#### Issue: Tokens Not Appearing

**Symptoms:**
- Tokens don't show in wallet
- Balance shows zero
- Transaction confirmed but no tokens

**Solutions:**
1. **Wait for Confirmation**: Allow time for blockchain confirmation
2. **Refresh Wallet**: Refresh or restart wallet application
3. **Add Token Manually**: Add token contract address to wallet
4. **Check Address**: Verify correct wallet address
5. **View on Explorer**: Check transaction on blockchain explorer
6. **Check Spam**: Some wallets hide tokens in spam folder

#### Issue: Wrong Token Amount

**Symptoms:**
- Received different amount than expected
- Balance doesn't match transaction
- Partial token receipt

**Solutions:**
1. **Check Transaction**: Review transaction details on explorer
2. **Verify Amount**: Confirm amount sent matches expected
3. **Check Fees**: Account for gas fees and platform fees
4. **Review Bonding Curve**: Price may have changed during transaction
5. **Contact Support**: If amount significantly different, contact support

### Cross-Chain Issues

#### Issue: OFT Claim Fails

**Symptoms:**
- Claim button doesn't work
- Transaction fails during claim
- Tokens not received on target chain

**Solutions:**
1. **Check Bridge Status**: Verify LayerZero bridge is operational
2. **Verify Chains**: Ensure both chains are supported
3. **Check Fees**: Ensure sufficient funds for bridge fees
4. **Wait for Processing**: Bridge transfers can take 10-30 minutes
5. **Check Target Wallet**: Verify correct wallet connected for target chain
6. **Review Transaction**: Check transaction on source chain explorer

#### Issue: Claim Stuck

**Symptoms:**
- Claim transaction confirmed but tokens not received
- Stuck in "Processing" state
- No update after extended time

**Solutions:**
1. **Check LayerZero Status**: Verify LayerZero network status
2. **View Transaction**: Check transaction on both chains
3. **Wait Longer**: Bridge transfers can take time
4. **Contact Support**: If stuck > 1 hour, provide transaction hash
5. **Check Target Chain**: Verify target chain is operational

### Privacy/Shielded Pool Issues

#### Issue: Privacy Not Working

**Symptoms:**
- Transactions appear transparent
- Anonymity set shows as 1
- No privacy protection

**Solutions:**
1. **Verify Privacy Enabled**: Check if token has privacy features
2. **Check Pool Status**: Verify shielded pool is active
3. **Wait for Participants**: Anonymity set needs multiple participants
4. **Review Settings**: Ensure privacy is enabled in token settings
5. **Check Contract**: Verify smart contract supports privacy

#### Issue: Small Anonymity Set

**Symptoms:**
- Anonymity set is very small (< 10)
- Privacy level shows as "Low"
- Concerned about privacy

**Solutions:**
1. **Wait for More Participants**: Set grows as more people participate
2. **Check Token Popularity**: Popular tokens have larger sets
3. **Consider Timing**: Participate when pool is more active
4. **Review Privacy Needs**: Evaluate if current set size is acceptable
5. **Monitor Set Size**: Watch set size over time
