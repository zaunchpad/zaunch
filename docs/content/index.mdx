# About Zaunchpad

Zaunchpad is a next-generation decentralized launchpad that bridges the gap between privacy and transparency. It allows users to launch and participate in token sales across multiple chains (Solana, NEAR) while leveraging privacy features and advanced bonding curve mechanisms via Meteora.

## Overview

Zaunchpad enables privacy-first token launches by combining:

- **Multi-Chain Support**: Seamlessly operate across **Solana** and **NEAR** blockchains
- **Privacy Features**: Anonymous participation using Zcash shielded pools
- **Dynamic Bonding Curves**: Integration with **Meteora DLMM** for efficient price discovery *(Coming Soon)*
- **Cross-Chain Bridging**: Built-in bridge functionality using **Omni Bridge** and LayerZero technology *(Coming Soon)*
- **NEAR Intents**: Leverage NEAR's intent-based architecture for seamless cross-chain operations
- **OFT (Omnichain Fungible Token)**: Claim tokens across different chains using LayerZero's OFT standard *(Coming Soon)*

## Key Features

### Privacy-First Design

Zaunchpad is designed with anonymous participation in mind. By leveraging Zcash shielded pools, participants can engage in token launches without revealing their identity or transaction history.

### Cross-Chain Token Launches

Launch tokens on one chain and make them available across multiple chains. Our integration with LayerZero and Omni Bridge enables seamless cross-chain token distribution. *(Coming Soon)*

### Advanced Bonding Curves

Meteora's dynamic bonding curves provide efficient price discovery and liquidity mechanisms, ensuring fair token pricing during launches. *(Coming Soon)*

### NEAR Intents Integration

NEAR Intents allow for declarative cross-chain operations, making it easier to coordinate token launches across different blockchains.
