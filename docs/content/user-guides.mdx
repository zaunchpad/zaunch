# User Guides

This guide walks you through the complete process of using Zaunchpad, whether you're launching a token, buying tokens, or managing your dashboard.

## How to Create Token

### Step 1: Connect Your Wallet

1. Navigate to [app.zaunchpad.com](https://app.zaunchpad.com)
2. Click "Connect Wallet" in the top right
3. Select your Solana wallet:
   - **Phantom**, **Solflare**, or other Solana wallets

### Step 2: Navigate to Create Page

1. Click "CREATE" in the navigation menu
2. Or navigate directly to `/create`

![Launch Token Page](/assets/launch-token-page.png)

### Step 3: Token Information (Step 01. INFO)

The first step involves configuring your token's basic information and branding.

#### Test Mode (Optional)

You can enable **Test Mode** to auto-fill sample data for testing purposes. This is useful for exploring the interface without entering all fields manually.

![Launch Token with Test Mode](/assets/launch-token-with-test-mode.png)

#### Token Details

1. **Token Name** (Required): The full name of your token
   - Example: "My Awesome Token"
   - This field is disabled if using an existing token

2. **Token Symbol** (Required): Short symbol (max 5 characters)
   - Example: "MAT"
   - Automatically converted to uppercase
   - This field is disabled if using an existing token

#### New Token vs Existing Token

You have two options:

**Option A: Create New Token**
- Leave "I have an existing Token" unchecked
- Configure:
  - **Token Supply** (Required): Total number of tokens to mint (e.g., 1000000)
  - **Decimal** (Required): Token decimals (typically 6 or 9)

**Option B: Use Existing Token**
- Check "I have an existing Token"
- Enter **Token Mint Address** (Required): Your Solana SPL token mint address
- The system will automatically fetch and display token information
- Token name, symbol, and other details will be auto-filled from the blockchain

![Existing Token](/assets/existing-token.png)

> **Note**: For existing tokens, you'll transfer the sale allocation into the Zaunchpad Shielded Vault. Buyers purchase tickets anonymously, and when they claim, the Vault releases your tokens to their fresh wallets, breaking the link between payment and claim.

#### Token Description

- **Description** (Optional): Describe your token and project
- This helps potential buyers understand your project

#### Token Logo

- **Token Icon** (Required): Upload your token logo
- You can:
  - Drag and drop an image file
  - Click to browse and select a file
  - Paste from clipboard (Ctrl+V / Cmd+V)
- Supported formats: Common image formats (PNG, JPG, SVG, etc.)

#### Social Links (Optional)

Add your project's social media presence:

- **X/Twitter**: Enter username (e.g., "username" for x.com/username)
- **Telegram**: Enter channel/handle (e.g., "channel" for t.me/channel)
- **Website**: Enter domain (e.g., "example.com" for https://example.com)

All social URLs are validated automatically.

#### Proceed to Next Step

Once you've filled in all required fields (Token Name, Symbol, Logo, and either Token Supply/Decimal for new tokens or Mint Address for existing tokens), click **"NEXT STEP →"** to proceed.

### Step 4: Sale Parameters (Step 02. SALE PARAMETERS)

The second step configures your token sale economics and timing.

![Sale Parameters](/assets/sale-parameters.png)

#### Testnet Notice

On testnet, the maximum price per token is capped at **$0.10** to minimize risk while testing with real funds on NEAR Intents.

#### Pricing

1. **Price per Token (USD)** (Required)
   - Enter the price in USD (e.g., 0.00001)
   - Maximum: $0.10 on testnet
   - The system automatically converts this to SOL based on current market prices

#### Sale Amounts

1. **Minimum Raise (Tokens)** (Coming Soon)
   - Currently disabled - coming in a future update
   - Will allow setting a funding goal with automatic refunds if not met

2. **Amount to be Sold (Tokens)** (Required)
   - Total number of tokens available for sale
   - Example: 100000
   - This amount goes into the vault for distribution

#### Sale Timing

1. **Sale Start Time** (Required)
   - Select when your token sale begins
   - Must be in the future
   - Use the datetime picker to set date and time

2. **Sale End Time** (Required)
   - Select when your token sale ends
   - Must be after the start time
   - Minimum: 1 minute after start time

#### Claim Schedule

Currently, only **Immediate Claim** is available:
- Claims can begin immediately after the sale ends
- **Scheduled Claim** (coming soon): Set a custom date for when buyers can claim

#### Creator Wallet (ZEC)

**Creator Wallet (ZEC)** (Required): Your Zcash wallet address to receive funds from NEAR Intents

- Supports three address types:
  - **Transparent addresses**: Start with `t1...` (34-36 characters)
  - **Shielded addresses**: Start with `zs...` (77-79 characters)
  - **Unified addresses**: Start with `u1...` (78+ characters)

**How to get a ZEC address:**

1. Download a Zcash wallet:
   - [ZecWallet Lite](https://zecwallet.co/) or
   - [YWallet](https://ywallet.app/)
2. Create a new wallet and securely save your seed phrase
3. Copy your receiving address (starts with t1, zs, or u1)

> 💡 **Privacy Tip**: For better privacy, use a shielded (zs) or unified (u1) address instead of a transparent (t1) address.

#### How It Works

- Sale end time must be after start time
- After sale ends, creators can claim any unsold tokens via ZK proof verification
- Claim period starts immediately after sale ends
- Buyers purchase tickets anonymously using ZEC via NEAR Intents

#### Coming Soon Features

- **Scheduled Claim**: Set a custom date for when buyers can claim their tokens
- **Minimum Raise**: Set a funding goal; if not met, buyers get automatic refunds
- **Buyer Refunds**: If target not hit, tickets can be used to reclaim funds
- **Vesting Schedules**: Release tokens gradually over time
- **Whitelist/Allowlist**: Restrict who can participate in the sale

#### Deploy Token

Once all required fields are filled:
1. Review all settings carefully
2. Click **"DEPLOY TOKEN"**
3. Confirm the transaction in your wallet

![Confirm Transaction](/assets/confirm-transaction.png)

4. Wait for deployment progress:
   - Preparing Token
   - Uploading Metadata to IPFS
   - Deploying Token on Blockchain
   - Confirming Transaction

![Deploying Token](/assets/deploying-token.png)

## How to Buy Token

### Step 1: Browse Available Launches

1. Visit the main page to see all available token launches
2. Click "EXPLORE LAUNCHES" in the navigation
3. Browse active token sales
4. Click on a token to view details

![Explore Launch Page](/assets/explore-launch-page.png)

### Step 2: Review Token Information

Before participating, review the token detail page:

![Token Detail Page](/assets/token-detail-page.png)

Review the following information:

- **Token Details**: Name, symbol, description, logo
- **Launch Parameters**: Price per token, total supply, amount to sell
- **Timing**: Start time, end time, claim period
- **Creator Information**: Launch creator details
- **Privacy Features**: Shielded pool participation
- **Sale Status**: Whether the sale is active, upcoming, or ended

### Step 3: Deposit with Any Asset (NEAR Intents)

Using NEAR Intents, the system automatically swaps your deposit to Zcash:

1. Click "Participate" or "Buy" on the token page
2. Connect your NEAR wallet if not already connected
3. **Select Payment Chain**: Choose the blockchain you want to pay from
   - Supported chains: Ethereum, NEAR, Base, Arbitrum, Polygon, and more

<img src="/assets/payment-select-chain.png" width="300" />

4. **Select Payment Token**: Choose the token you want to use
   - **ETH**, **USDC**, **USDT**, **NEAR**, or other supported tokens

<img src="/assets/payment-select-token.png" width="300" />

5. **Enter Deposit Amount**: Enter the amount you want to deposit

<img src="/assets/enter-amount.png" width="300" />

6. Review the transaction details:
   - **Deposit Amount**: Amount you're depositing
   - **Swap Details**: Automatic swap to Zcash via OneClick
   - **Expected ZEC**: Amount of Zcash after swap
   - **Network Fees**: Transaction costs
7. Confirm the transaction

![Deposit](/assets/deposit.jpg)

8. Click "Check Status" - After your deposit is confirmed, click the "Check Status" button. The claim option will then appear.

![Proof Generation](/assets/proof-generation.jpg)

### Step 4: ZK-SNARK Proof Generation

After your deposit and swap are verified:

1. **TEE Verification**: Phala TEE verifies swap success
   - Checks swap status is SUCCESS (via OneClick API)
   - Verifies recipient matches creator
   - Confirms destination asset is ZEC (nep141:zec.omft.near)
2. **Proof Generation**: TEE generates zero-knowledge proof
   - Acts as an IOU of predetermined amount at mint price
   - This proof is your claim ticket
3. **Proof Download**: Download the proof ZIP file
   - Save it securely - you'll need it to claim tokens
   - Each proof gets a unique reference (e.g., `zk_proof_a1b2c3d4`)

### Step 5: Capital Allocation

1. Allocated capital is deposited into the Meteora pool
2. Provides liquidity for the token launch
3. Maintains your privacy throughout the process

2. Ensure wallet has sufficient SOL for transaction fees
3. Verify you're on the correct network (Solana mainnet)

### Step 4: Create Claim Transaction

1. The system creates a compact claim transaction
2. Includes:
   - Your ZK proof
