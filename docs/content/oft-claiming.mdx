# Claiming with OFT

> **Coming Soon**: Cross-chain claiming via LayerZero OFT will be available soon! You will be able to claim tokens on different chains using the Omnichain Fungible Token standard.

## What is OFT?

OFT (Omnichain Fungible Token) is LayerZero's standard for tokens that exist across multiple blockchains. It allows a single token to exist on multiple chains while maintaining:

- **Unified Supply**: Total supply tracked across all chains
- **Cross-Chain Transfers**: Seamless movement between chains
- **Single Source of Truth**: LayerZero protocol manages state

## Current Status

Cross-chain claiming via OFT is **coming soon**. When available, you will be able to:

- **Claim on Solana**: Direct claims to your Solana wallet using ZK proofs
- **Cross-Chain Claims**: Claim tokens on multiple supported chains

## Available Features *(Coming Soon)*

When OFT claiming is available, you will be able to:

### Claim on Multiple Chains

- Claim tokens on Solana
- Claim tokens on NEAR
- Claim tokens on Base
- Claim tokens on Arbitrum
- Claim tokens on other LayerZero-supported chains

### Bridge Tokens

- Bridge tokens between supported chains
- Maintain token supply across chains
- Seamless cross-chain transfers

## How It Works

### Token Distribution

When a token is launched with cross-chain support:

1. Token is created on Solana (primary chain)
2. OFT bridge is configured automatically
3. Token becomes claimable on secondary chains

### Claiming Process

### Claiming Steps

1. **Verify Token Supports OFT**: Check if token has cross-chain support
2. **Connect Target Chain Wallet**: Connect wallet for desired chain
3. **Initiate Claim**: Start cross-chain claim process
4. **Bridge Processing**: LayerZero processes the transfer
5. **Token Receipt**: Receive tokens on target chain

## Claiming Options *(Coming Soon)*

When OFT claiming is available, you will be able to:

- **Claim on Solana**: Use ZK proofs to claim tokens directly on Solana
- **Claim on Multiple Chains**: Use OFT to claim tokens on NEAR, Base, Arbitrum, and other supported chains
- **Bridge Tokens**: Move tokens between chains seamlessly
- **View Your Dashboard**: Track all your purchases and claims
- **Manage Proofs**: Organize your proof files for future claims
