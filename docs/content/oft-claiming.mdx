# Claiming with OFT

> **Coming Soon**: Cross-chain claiming via LayerZero OFT is currently under development. This feature will allow you to claim tokens on different chains using the Omnichain Fungible Token standard.

## What is OFT?

OFT (Omnichain Fungible Token) is LayerZero's standard for tokens that exist across multiple blockchains. When available, it will allow a single token to exist on multiple chains while maintaining:

- **Unified Supply**: Total supply tracked across all chains
- **Cross-Chain Transfers**: Seamless movement between chains
- **Single Source of Truth**: LayerZero protocol manages state

## Current Status

Cross-chain claiming via OFT is **not yet available**. Currently, you can:

- ✅ **Claim on Solana**: Direct claims to your Solana wallet using ZK proofs
- ❌ **Cross-Chain Claims**: Coming soon

## Planned Features

When OFT claiming is available, you will be able to:

### Claim on Multiple Chains

- Claim tokens on Solana (currently available)
- Claim tokens on NEAR (coming soon)
- Claim tokens on Base (coming soon)
- Claim tokens on Arbitrum (coming soon)
- Claim tokens on other LayerZero-supported chains (coming soon)

### Bridge Tokens

- Bridge tokens between supported chains
- Maintain token supply across chains
- Seamless cross-chain transfers

## How It Will Work (Planned)

### Token Distribution

When a token is launched with cross-chain support:

1. Token is created on Solana (primary chain)
2. OFT bridge is configured automatically
3. Token becomes claimable on secondary chains

### Claiming Process

```
Token on Solana → OFT Bridge → Token on Target Chain
```

### Claiming Steps (Planned)

1. **Verify Token Supports OFT**: Check if token has cross-chain support
2. **Connect Target Chain Wallet**: Connect wallet for desired chain
3. **Initiate Claim**: Start cross-chain claim process
4. **Bridge Processing**: LayerZero processes the transfer
5. **Token Receipt**: Receive tokens on target chain

## Stay Updated

To be notified when OFT claiming becomes available:

- Check the [Zaunchpad GitHub](https://github.com/zaunchpad/zaunchpad) for updates
- Follow our announcements
- Monitor the documentation for feature releases

## Current Claiming Options

While OFT claiming is under development, you can:

- **Claim on Solana**: Use ZK proofs to claim tokens directly on Solana
- **View Your Dashboard**: Track all your purchases and claims
- **Manage Proofs**: Organize your proof files for future claims

See [How to Claim Token](/docs/user-steps#how-to-claim-token) for current claiming instructions.
