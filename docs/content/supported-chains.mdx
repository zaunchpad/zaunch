# Supported Chains

Zaunchpad supports multiple blockchains for payments and token claims, with more chains coming soon through various bridge integrations.

## Supported Payment Chains

Zaunchpad accepts payments from multiple chains through **NEAR Intents** integration. When you make a deposit, the system automatically swaps your payment to Zcash (ZEC) for anonymous participation.

### Currently Supported Payment Chains

You can deposit using tokens from these chains:

- **Ethereum**: ETH, USDC, USDT, and other ERC-20 tokens
- **NEAR**: NEAR token and NEAR-based tokens
- **Base**: ETH, USDC, and other Base tokens
- **Arbitrum**: ETH, USDC, and other Arbitrum tokens
- **Polygon**: MATIC, USDC, and other Polygon tokens
- **And more**: Additional chains supported by NEAR Intents

### How Payment Chains Work

1. **Select Payment Chain**: Choose the blockchain you want to pay from
2. **Select Payment Token**: Choose ETH, USDC, USDT, NEAR, or other supported tokens
3. **Automatic Swap**: NEAR Intents automatically swaps your deposit to Zcash (ZEC)
4. **Anonymous Participation**: Your payment is processed through Zcash shielded pools

See [Working with NEAR Intents](/docs/near-intents) for more details on how deposits work.

## Token Claim Channels

### Original Token Claim Channel on Solana

**Currently Available**: All tokens launched on Zaunchpad can be claimed directly on **Solana**.

- **Primary Chain**: Solana is the primary chain for token launches
- **Direct Claims**: Claim tokens directly to your Solana wallet using ZK proofs
- **No Bridge Required**: Direct claims on Solana don't require cross-chain bridging
- **Fast & Efficient**: Solana's high throughput ensures quick claim processing

When you claim a token:
1. Generate or use your ZK proof
2. Connect your Solana wallet (Phantom, Solflare, etc.)
3. Submit your claim transaction
4. Receive tokens directly in your Solana wallet

See [How to Claim Token](/docs/user-guides#how-to-claim-token) for detailed claiming instructions.

### Cross-Chain Claims via LayerZero OFT *(Coming Soon)*

Cross-chain token claims will be available soon through **LayerZero's OFT (Omnichain Fungible Token)** standard:

- **Solana ↔ NEAR**: Claim tokens on NEAR
- **Solana ↔ Base**: Claim tokens on Base
- **Solana ↔ Arbitrum**: Claim tokens on Arbitrum
- **NEAR ↔ Base**: Bridge between NEAR and Base
- **NEAR ↔ Arbitrum**: Bridge between NEAR and Arbitrum
- **And more**: Additional LayerZero-supported chains

See [Claiming with OFT](/docs/oft-claiming) for more information about cross-chain claiming.

### Cross-Chain Claims via deBridge *(Coming Soon)*

Coming soon through **deBridge** claims, linking to [deBridge supported chains](https://docs.debridge.finance/developers/blockchains).

deBridge will enable:
- **Expanded Chain Support**: Access to all deBridge-supported chains
- **Flexible Claims**: Claim tokens on any deBridge-connected chain
- **Secure Bridging**: Leverage deBridge's secure cross-chain infrastructure

deBridge supports a wide range of chains including:
- Ethereum and EVM-compatible chains
- Solana
- NEAR
- And many more

Check the [deBridge documentation](https://docs.debridge.finance/developers/blockchains) for the complete list of supported chains.
