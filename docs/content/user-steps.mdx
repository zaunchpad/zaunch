# User Steps

This guide walks you through the complete process of using Zaunchpad, whether you're launching a token, buying tokens, or managing your dashboard.

## How to Create Token

### Step 1: Connect Your Wallet

1. Navigate to [app.zaunchpad.com](https://app.zaunchpad.com)
2. Click "Connect Wallet" in the top right
3. Select your Solana wallet:
   - **Phantom**, **Solflare**, or other Solana wallets

### Step 2: Navigate to Create Page

1. Click "CREATE" in the navigation menu
2. Or navigate directly to `/create`

### Step 3: Set Pricing

1. Outline price and number of tokens per Zcash
2. Define your token economics:
   - **Total Supply**: Total tokens to mint
   - **Amount to Sell**: Tokens available for claims (goes to vault)
   - **Price Per Token**: Price in micro-USD (USD × 10^6). Example: $0.01 = 10000
   - **Tokens Per Proof**: Number of tokens per proof claim
   - **Min Amount to Sell**: Optional minimum (0 = no minimum required)

### Step 4: Configure Token Details

1. Fill in token information:
   - **Token Name**: The name of your token
   - **Token Symbol**: Short symbol (e.g., "MYTKN")
   - **Token URI**: Metadata URI (optional)
   - **Decimals**: Token decimals (typically 9)
2. Upload token logo/icon (optional but recommended)

### Step 5: Multi-Chain Configuration

1. Choose whether to enable Layer Zero for multichain claims
2. Select which supported chains your token can be claimed on
3. Configure cross-chain settings (if enabled)

### Step 6: Timeline Setup

1. Define launch timing:
   - **Start Time**: When the token sale begins
   - **End Time**: When the token sale ends
   - **Claim Period**: When claims can begin (after end time)
2. Set specific dates and durations

### Step 7: Minimum Requirements

1. Set minimum thresholds for successful token launch
2. Configure claim eligibility requirements
3. Protect both you and your investors

### Step 8: Create Launch

1. Review all settings one final time
2. Confirm the deployment transaction
3. Wait for Solana blockchain confirmation
4. Your token launch is now live!

## How to Buy Token

### Step 1: Browse Available Launches

1. Visit the main page to see all available token launches
2. Click "EXPLORE LAUNCHES" in the navigation
3. Browse active token sales
4. Click on a token to view details

### Step 2: Review Token Information

Before participating, review:

- **Token Details**: Name, symbol, description
- **Launch Parameters**: Price, total supply, amount to sell
- **Timing**: Start time, end time, claim period
- **Creator Information**: Launch creator details
- **Privacy Features**: Shielded pool participation

### Step 3: Deposit with Any Asset (NEAR Intents)

Using NEAR Intents, the system automatically swaps your deposit to Zcash:

1. Click "Participate" or "Buy" on the token page
2. Connect your NEAR wallet if not already connected
3. Enter the amount you want to deposit
4. Select your payment token:
   - **ETH**, **USDC**, **NEAR**, or other supported tokens
5. Review the transaction details:
   - **Deposit Amount**: Amount you're depositing
   - **Swap Details**: Automatic swap to Zcash via OneClick
   - **Expected ZEC**: Amount of Zcash after swap
   - **Network Fees**: Transaction costs
6. Confirm the transaction

### Step 4: ZK-SNARK Proof Generation

After your deposit and swap are verified:

1. **TEE Verification**: Phala TEE verifies swap success
   - Checks swap status is SUCCESS (via OneClick API)
   - Verifies recipient matches creator
   - Confirms destination asset is ZEC (nep141:zec.omft.near)
2. **Proof Generation**: TEE generates zero-knowledge proof
   - Acts as an IOU of predetermined amount at mint price
   - This proof is your claim ticket
3. **Proof Download**: Download the proof ZIP file
   - Save it securely - you'll need it to claim tokens
   - Each proof gets a unique reference (e.g., `zk_proof_a1b2c3d4`)

### Step 5: Capital Allocation

1. Allocated capital is deposited into the Meteora pool
2. Provides liquidity for the token launch
3. Maintains your privacy throughout the process

## How to Claim Token

### Step 1: Wait for Claim Period

1. Claims can only begin after the launch `end_time`
2. Check the token page for claim availability
3. Monitor the launch status

### Step 2: Load Your Proof

1. Locate the proof ZIP file you downloaded during purchase
2. Use the proof loader in the claim interface
3. Verify proof details:
   - Launch PDA
   - Token mint address
   - Claim amount
   - Deposit address

### Step 3: Connect Solana Wallet

1. Connect your Solana wallet (Phantom, Solflare, etc.)
2. Ensure wallet has sufficient SOL for transaction fees
3. Verify you're on the correct network

### Step 4: Create Claim Transaction

1. The system creates a compact claim transaction
2. Includes:
   - Your ZK proof
   - Launch PDA
   - Token mint
   - Claim amount
   - Deposit address verification
3. Review transaction details

### Step 5: Submit and Confirm

1. Submit the claim transaction
2. Confirm in your wallet
3. Wait for Solana confirmation
4. Tokens will be transferred to your wallet

### Step 6: Flexible Claiming Options

With the claim system via proofs, you can:

- **Claim on Solana**: Direct claim to your Solana wallet
- **Bridge via Omni Token**: Claim on your desired Layer Zero OFT supported chain (coming soon)
